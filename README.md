# Hello!

This is the source code for the twitter bot
[@snowfall_exe](https://twitter.com/snowfall_exe), which takes images
sent to it and turns them into animated GIFs with falling snow.

To run it, you'll need to install ImageMagick. Other than that, the
dependencies are pretty simple and running bundler should handle them.
Enjoy!
